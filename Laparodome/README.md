Laparoscopic surgery represents the new standard of care for operations due to both faster recovery times and better patient outcomes. As a result, educational efforts developed to train the next generation of physicians basic laparoscopic techniques are vital as more and more procedures are converted from open surgery to laparoscopic operations. While training curriculums such as the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) are in place and are able to adequately assess abilities in the United States, these modules and certifications are prohibitively expensive, especially in low middle income countries (LMICs) where resources are already stretched thin due to other needs in the healthcare system. For example, surgeons in Costa Rica only train for 17% of the time as their United States counterparts on basic laparoscopic surgical skills. Rather than focusing on specific procedures or relying on expensive technology and other peripherals, Laparodome aims to address this unmet area of need by creating a low cost, durable, and portable platform to simulate the conditions of a standard laparoscopic setup and faithfully reproduce the training guidelines equivalent to those eoutlined by FLS. Additionally, the design of Laparodome also allows for use for medical students to be able to receive a head start on basic laparoscopic techniques by allowing for practice outside of a simulation lab in a wide variety of settings.
